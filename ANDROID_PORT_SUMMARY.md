## Key Technical Decisions

### ‚úÖ Chosen: Native Android (Kotlin + Compose)
**Rationale:**
- Best performance and platform integration
- Idiomatic Android development
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Similar declarative paradigm to SwiftUI
- Large developer community

### ‚ùå Rejected: Kotlin Multiplatform
**Rationale:**
- Too complex for initial port
- iOS still requires significant platform code
- Less mature tooling
- Can revisit for future code sharing

### ‚ùå Rejected: Flutter / React Native
**Rationale:**
- Non-native UI feel
- Performance overhead
- Completely different tech stack
- Larger app size

---

## Resource Requirements

### Recommended Team
- **2 Senior Android Developers** (full-time)
  - One: UI/UX focus (Compose expert)
  - One: Architecture/Backend focus
- **1 Backend Developer** (part-time)
  - Push notification proxy adaptation
- **1 QA Engineer** (half-time)
  - Test automation and manual testing
- **1 Designer** (consultation)
  - Android-specific UI/UX adaptations

**Total:** ~2.5 FTE for 12 months

### Solo Developer Option
- **Timeline:** 18-24 months
- **Strategy:** MVP-first, phased feature rollout
- **Focus:** Core features (timeline, posting) first

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Investment
- **Development:** 12 person-months (team) or 18-24 months (solo)
- **Infrastructure:** Push notification proxy hosting
- **Testing:** Device farm access, beta testing
- **Distribution:** Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)

### Benefits
- **Market Reach:** Access to 2.5B Android devices
- **Revenue:** Google Play in-app purchases
- **Community:** Expand open-source contributor base
- **Competition:** Only 3-4 major Mastodon Android clients

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **WebSocket Streaming Stability**
   - *Mitigation:* Robust reconnection, extensive testing, background service
   
2. **Push Notification Proxy**
   - *Mitigation:* Port iOS architecture, document for self-hosting
   
3. **Scope Creep**
   - *Mitigation:* Strict MVP definition, feature prioritization

### Success Factors
‚úÖ Start with solid foundation (models, networking)
‚úÖ Iterate rapidly with frequent testing
‚úÖ Maintain feature parity checklist
‚úÖ Focus on performance from day one
‚úÖ Build modular, maintainable architecture

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why not use Kotlin Multiplatform to share code with iOS?
**A:** KMP is great for new projects, but for an initial port from a mature iOS app, native Android is simpler and faster. We can evaluate KMP later for code sharing between maintained codebases.

### Q: Can we use Flutter or React Native instead?
**A:** While these frameworks enable cross-platform development, they don't provide the native platform feel and performance that users expect. Native Android with Compose is the best choice for a quality Android app.

### Q: How much of the iOS code can be reused?
**A:** ~70-80% of the business logic patterns are reusable (models, repositories, API clients), but UI code must be completely rewritten for Compose. This is expected and normal.

### Q: What's the biggest technical challenge?
**A:** The WebSocket streaming for real-time updates and the encrypted push notification proxy. Both require careful implementation and testing, but we can reuse the iOS architecture as a reference.

### Q: Can one developer do this solo?
**A:** Yes, but expect 18-24 months. Prioritize MVP features first: login, timeline, posting, notifications. Add advanced features post-launch.

### Q: Will it work on tablets and foldables?
**A:** Yes! Compose makes it easy to create adaptive UIs. We'll optimize for large screens in Phase 7 (Polish).

### Q: How do we handle iOS-only features like iCloud sync?
**A:** Replace with Android equivalents: Google Drive API or Firebase for cloud sync. Some features may not be needed (e.g., iOS-specific integrations).

### Q: What about Material You / dynamic theming?
**A:** Full support planned in Phase 7. Android 12+ users will get dynamic colors from their wallpaper, plus custom theme options.
